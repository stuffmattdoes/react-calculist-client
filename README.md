# Calculist (client-side) #
Your in-store shopping cart total. Know what you're spending before you spend it.

I am currently responsible for all design & development efforts.

## Requirements ##
This repository contains the client-facing app, and needs the server-side repository in order to run locally. You can download the server code [here](https://github.com/stuffmattdoes/react-calculist-server).

Your development environment needs the following software installed:

* [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## The Tech Stack ##


## Setup ##
Run the following commands in terminal/console in order to get setup locally:

1. `npm install` to install all development dependencies
2. `webpack` to compile static files, such as CSS and the classic Webpack Javascript bundle.

## Development ##
Run the following commands in terminal/console in order to develop locally:

1. `npm start` to start up webpack-dev-server, which will serve as our local static file server.
2. Dev away!

## Deployment ##
You shouldn't be deploying my code! But if you must know, I host the this client-side portion of the app on my own Digital Ocean droplet at [calculist.stuffmattdoes.com](https://calculist.stuffmattdoes.com). Head over there to register and shop on a budget!

## Roadmap ##
This app is in active development. To see a list of planned features, check out my [Calculist Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZQUkXrIX/calculist).
